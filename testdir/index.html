                        <p class="text-lg mb-6">Odne has been teaching the Meisner technique since 2018. Based on a series of progressive exercises, the Meisner technique is unique in its ability to train an actor in getting out of their own head, responding truthfully to what is happening in the moment, and creating performances grounded in a sense of expressive freedom.</p>
                          <p class="text-lg mb-6">At the heart of the technique is the Repetition Exercise. The exercise elevates our craft by forcing us to abstract from the text and focus on the true currency of the actor: behaviour. Within the exercise each student is taught to observe clearly the behaviour of the other actor(s) and respond impulsively. Not only does the exercise build these muscles of observing and responding but it also continually puts us face to face with our own barriers, giving us the opportunity to break past them and continually develop as artists. While it is the job of the student to overcome the barriers in their work it is the job of the teacher to provide a safe and encouraging space to do so, and the values of patience, self-compassion, and taking charge of your own journey as an actor are essential elements of Odne's teaching style.</p>
                          <p class="text-lg mb-6">Odne has taught private and public classes as well as regular drop-in classes. He has taught at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, Giles Foreman Centre for Acting, Fourth Monkey, and The Impulse Company, among others. He has also worked with second year students at Trinity Laban on a project combining Meisner with contemporary dance.</p>
                          <p class="text-lg mb-6">For any enquiries regarding private lessons for small groups, ad-hoc courses for theatre companies, or to have Odne teach at your academic institution get in touch using the form below</p>

                    <p class="text-lg mb-8 text-center md:max-w-screen-md md:mx-auto text-justify">Generally speaking the journey through Meisner's work goes through 3 stages. We begin with the definition of acting as <span class="italic">living truthfully under a given set of circumstances</span>. We begin with the <span class="font-bold">Repetition Exercise</span>, through which we discover what it means to observe clearly and respond truthfully, which we take to encapsulate the meaning of "living truthfully". We then move on to the <span class="font-bold">Independent Activity</span> through which we discover what it means to take circumstances as given and work fully within them, thereby ensuring the "under a given set of circumstances" part of our definition of acting. After that we move onto text and see how we can bring our work into text as well as how to approach text analysis and memorization.</p>
